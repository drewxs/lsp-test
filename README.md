# LSP Test

The language server will run on _every_ file type by default. To target specific languages, change

`package.json`'s `activationEvents` to something like

```
"activationEvents": [
  "onLanguage:plaintext"
],
```

And change the `documentSelector` in `client/src/extension.ts` to replace the `*` (e.g.)

```
documentSelector: [{ scheme: "file", language: "plaintext" }],
```

## Developing your extension

To help verify everything is working properly, we've included the following code in `server.ts` after the `onInitialize` function:

```typescript
documents.onDidChangeContent((change) => {
  connection.window.showInformationMessage(
    "onDidChangeContent: " + change.document.uri,
  );
});
```

From the root directory of this project, run `code .` Then in VS Code

1. Build the extension (both client and server) with `⌘+shift+B` (or `ctrl+shift+B` on windows)
2. Open the Run and Debug view and press "Launch Client" (or press `F5`). This will open a `[Extension Development Host]` VS Code window.
3. Opening or editing a file in that window should show an information message in VS Code like you see below.

   ![example information message](https://semanticart.com/misc-images/minimum-viable-vscode-language-server-extension-info-message.png)

4. Edits made to your `server.ts` will be rebuilt immediately but you'll need to "Launch Client" again (`⌘-shift-F5`) from the primary VS Code window to see the impact of your changes.

## Distributing your extension

Read the full [Publishing Extensions doc][publish] for the full details.

Note that you can package and distribute a standalone `.vsix` file without publishing it to the marketplace by following [these instructions][vsix].
